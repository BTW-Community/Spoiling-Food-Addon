# Spoiling-Food-Addon
Make food spoil. And definitely do not do a hundred other things as well.

## Core Idea:
- Make Food spoil
-- Needs a big scope to really make sense

## Core Goals:
- Leave fat as "realistic" as it is, but make it useful
- Probably make the game harder overall lol
- Add interesting gameplay rather than being a nuisance
- Easily get rotten flesh without needing to kill zombies


### Food will spoil
- Some ingredients should also spoil
- Different spoiling times per food type?
-- E.g. raw meat spoils faster than cookies
-- Should probably still be somewhat lenient but needs balancing
- Food spoiling needs to be easily visible/discernible/estimatable
-- Perhaps even exact best-before-date?
- Multi-Stage spoiling?
-- Some downsides to slightly spoiled food
-- FERMENTING? <.<
- Non-spoiling items?
-- Late game stuff for convenience?

### Non-natural animals age and can die of old age
- Probably make old animals somehow special (besides look), with different stats
-- For automation purposes
-- E.g. make them slower, slightly less tall, can't swim, can't jump, ...
- People would probably just do "Breeding Farms" ala Valheim with 2 immortal naturals on top, producing offspring
-- That perhaps needs addressing? E.g. making them lose immortality once the produced offspring

### Plants will decay
- Not the natural/village ones of course, else good luck getting these carrots from 2k blocks away
- To prevent "letting crops stay until needed" strategy
- Needs thoughtful balancing as well
- Also multi-stage
-- For visibility purposes
- Maybe only get "animal food" out of almost decayed ones
- What about seeds?

### Prevention of food spoilage
- Ability to slow food spoiling
- Fridges, cool boxes, etc, or Reverse Hibachis, of course. Perhaps Stoked Reverse Hibachis.
-- I like the idea of something with ice and snow, giving extra use to cold biomes
-- Something with automation would probably be more healthy though
-- Reverse Hibachis are fridges and Stoked Reverse Hibachis are freezers??
- Food preparation (similar to different spoiling times for food)
